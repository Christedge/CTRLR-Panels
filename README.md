# CTRLR-Panels

Some quick and dirty panel hacks I use. None of them can be used to control the synth. They only can be used to visualize how a patch of the synth is constructed.

The SE-02 only sends SysEx data in Poly Chain mode. To switch it on or off:

- Hold the Exit/Comp button while powering the unit.
- Press button B/2.
- Turn the value pot to either on or off.
- Press the value pot.
